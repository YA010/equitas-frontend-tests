# Frontend Developer Tech Test For Ortex 


# !Important Disclaimer

I finished this project within 1:45hr min , i had to pause my coding in betweeen, plus setting up plugins took some time 


I was going to utilize react router for pagination and rendering 

but i mostly focused on functionality and features

Also due to the constraints there were stuff i did that i dont normally do (rendering components within same page on click but since i didnt want to utilize react router for the aforementioned reason i had to resort to it)
