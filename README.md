# Frontend Developer Tech Test For Ortex 


# !Important Disclaimer

I have different names "EQUITAs" yahumble yusuf, that i use to commit for various projects so fyi

I finished this test within 1:45hr min , i had to pause my coding in betweeen, plus setting up plugins took some time 


I was going to utilize react router for pagination and rendering but didnt want to be disqualified

i mostly focused on functionality and features

Also due to the constraints there were stuff i did that i dont normally do (rendering components within same page on click but since i didnt want to utilize react router for the aforementioned reason i had to resort to it)

im looking forward to talking about this 


Thank you and have a lovely weekend
