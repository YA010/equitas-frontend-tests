# Frontend Developer Tech Test For EQUITA

# !Important Disclaimer


Was i correct to assume i couldn't use any external libaries or get any npm modules except the ones preinstalled, I was going to utilize react router for pagination and rendering but didnt want to be disqualified

i mostly focused on functionality and features rather than css but i assure you my css skills are top notch , you can browse my repos and see it on other projects too. 

Also due to the constraints there were stuff i did that i dont normally do (rendering components within same page on click is not recomended but since i had no access to react router i had to resort to it) i hope some considerations can be made and im looking forward to talking about this 

Thank you and have a lovely weekend
